Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — K
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There are N+Q points A_1,\dots,A_N,B_1,\dots,B_Q on a number line, where point A_i has a coordinate a_i and point B_j has a coordinate b_j.
      For each j=1,2,\dots,Q, answer the following question:

      - Let X be the point among A_1,A_2,\dots,A_N that is the k_j-th closest to point B_j. Find the distance between points X and B_j.
      More formally, let d_i be the distance between points A_i and B_j. Sort (d_1,d_2,\dots,d_N) in ascending order to get the sequence (d_1',d_2',\dots,d_N'). Find d_{k_j}'.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N Q
      a_1 a_2 \dots a_N
      b_1 k_1
      b_2 k_2
      \vdots
      b_Q k_Q

      Output

      Print Q lines.
      The l-th line (1 \leq l \leq Q) should contain the answer to the question for j=l as an integer.

      Constraints


      - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 10^5
      - -10^8 \leq a_i, b_j \leq 10^8
      - 1 \leq k_j \leq N
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      4 3
      -3 -1 5 6
      -2 3
      2 1
      10 4

      Sample Output 1

      7
      3
      13

      Let us explain the first query.
      The distances from points A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 to point B_1 are 1, 1, 7, 8, respectively, so the 3rd closest to point B_1 is point A_3.
      Therefore, print the distance between point A_3 and point B_1, which is 7.

      Sample Input 2

      2 2
      0 0
      0 1
      0 2

      Sample Output 2

      0
      0

      There may be multiple points with the same coordinates.

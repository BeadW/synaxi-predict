  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are given a tree with N vertices.
      The vertices are numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.
      The i-th edge (1\leq i\leq N-1) connects vertices U_i and V_i, with a length of L_i.
      For each K=1,2,\ldots, N, solve the following problem.

      Takahashi and Aoki play a game. The game proceeds as follows.

      - First, Aoki specifies K distinct vertices on the tree.
      - Then, Takahashi constructs a walk that starts and ends at vertex 1, and passes through all the vertices specified by Aoki.

      The score is defined as the length of the walk constructed by Takahashi. Takahashi wants to minimize the score, while Aoki wants to maximize it.
      Find the score when both players play optimally.


      Definition of a walk
          A walk on an undirected graph (possibly a tree) is a sequence of k vertices and k-1 edges v_1,e_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{k-1},e_{k-1},v_k (where k is a positive integer)
          such that edge e_i connects vertices v_i and v_{i+1}. The same vertex or edge can appear multiple times in the sequence.  
          A walk is said to pass through vertex x if there exists at least one i (1\leq i\leq k) such that v_i=x. (There can be multiple such i.)  
          The walk is said to start and end at v_1 and v_k, respectively, and the length of the walk is the sum of the lengths of e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_{k-1}.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      U_1 V_1 L_1
      U_2 V_2 L_2
      \vdots
      U_{N-1} V_{N-1} L_{N-1}

      Output

      Print N lines.
      The i-th line (1\leq i\leq N) should contain the answer to the problem for K=i.

      Constraints


      - 2\leq N\leq 2\times 10^5
      - 1\leq U_i<V_i\leq N
      - 1\leq L_i\leq 10^9
      - All input values are integers.
      - The given graph is a tree.

      For K=1, Aoki's optimal move is to specify vertex 3, and Takahashi's optimal move is to construct a path vertex 1 \to vertex 2 \to vertex 3 \to vertex 2 \to vertex 1, resulting in a score of 16.
      For K=2, Aoki's optimal move is to specify vertices 3 and

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox

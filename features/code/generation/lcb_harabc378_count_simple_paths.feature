Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Count Simple Paths
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There is a grid of H \times W cells. Let (i, j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.
      Cell (i, j) is empty if S_{i,j} is ., and blocked if it is #.
      Count the number of ways to start from an empty cell and make K moves to adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right), without passing through blocked squares and not visiting the same cell more than once.
      Specifically, count the number of sequences of length K+1, ((i_0, j_0), (i_1, j_1), \dots, (i_K, j_K)), satisfying the following.

      - 1 \leq i_k \leq H, 1 \leq j_k \leq W, and S_{i_k, j_k} is ., for each 0 \leq k \leq K.
      - |i_{k+1} - i_k| + |j_{k+1} - j_k| = 1 for each 0 \leq k \leq K-1.
      - (i_k, j_k) \neq (i_l, j_l) for each 0 \leq k < l \leq K.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      H W K
      S_{1,1}S_{1,2}\dots S_{1,W}
      S_{2,1}S_{2,2}\dots S_{2,W}
      \vdots
      S_{H,1}S_{H,2}\dots S_{H,W}

      Output

      Print the answer.

      Constraints


      - 1 \leq H, W \leq 10
      - 1 \leq K \leq 11
      - H, W, and K are integers.
      - Each S_{i,j} is . or #.
      - There is at least one empty cell.

      Sample Input 1

      2 2 2
      .#
      ..

      Sample Output 1

      2

      Here are the two possible paths:

      - (1,1) \rightarrow (2,1) \rightarrow (2,2)
      - (2,2) \rightarrow (2,1) \rightarrow (1,1)

      Sample Input 2

      2 3 1
      .#.
      #.#

      Sample Output 2

      0

      Sample Input 3

      10 10 11

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

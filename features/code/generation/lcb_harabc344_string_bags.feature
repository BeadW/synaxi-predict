Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — String Bags
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You initially have an empty string S.
      Additionally, there are bags 1, 2, \dots, N, each containing some strings.
      Bag i contains A_i strings S_{i,1}, S_{i,2}, \dots, S_{i,A_i}.
      You will repeat the following steps for i = 1, 2, \dots, N:

      - Choose and perform one of the following two actions:
      - Pay 1 yen, select exactly one string from bag i, and concatenate it to the end of S.
      - Do nothing.



      Given a string T, find the minimum amount of money required to make the final S equal T.
      If there is no way to make the final S equal T, print -1.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      T
      N
      A_1 S_{1,1} S_{1,2} \dots S_{1,A_1}
      A_2 S_{2,1} S_{2,2} \dots S_{2,A_2}
      \vdots
      A_N S_{N,1} S_{N,2} \dots S_{N,A_N}

      Output

      Print the answer as an integer.

      Constraints


      - T is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 100, inclusive.
      - N is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
      - A_i is an integer between 1 and 10, inclusive.
      - S_{i,j} is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10, inclusive.

      Sample Input 1

      abcde
      3
      3 ab abc abcd
      4 f c cd bcde
      2 e de

      Sample Output 1

      2

      For example, doing the following makes the final S equal T with two yen, which can be shown to be the minimum amount required.

      - For i=1, select abc from bag 1 and concatenate it to the end of S, making S= abc.
      - For i=2, do nothing.
      - For i=3, select de from bag 3 and concatenate it to the end of S, making S= abcde.

      Sample Input 2

      abcde
      3
      2 ab abc
      3 f c bcde
      1 e

      Sample Output 2

      -1

      There is no way to make the final S equal T, so print -1.

      Sample Input 3

      aaabbbbcccc
      6
      2 aa aaa
      2 dd ddd
      2 ab aabb
      4 bbaa bbbc bbb bbcc
      2 cc bcc
      3 ccc cccc ccccc

  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      Your refrigerator has N kinds of ingredients. Let us call them ingredient 1, \dots, ingredient N. You have Q_i grams of ingredient i.
      You can make two types of dishes. To make one serving of dish A, you need A_i grams of each ingredient i (1 \leq i \leq N). To make one serving of dish B, you need B_i grams of each ingredient i. You can only make an integer number of servings of each type of dish.
      Using only the ingredients in the refrigerator, what is the maximum total number of servings of dishes you can make?

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      Q_1 Q_2 \dots Q_N
      A_1 A_2 \dots A_N
      B_1 B_2 \dots B_N

      Output

      Assuming that you can make a maximum total of S servings of dishes, print the integer S.

      Constraints


      - 1 \leq N \leq 10
      - 1 \leq Q_i \leq 10^6
      - 0 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
      - There is an i such that A_i \geq 1.
      - 0 \leq B_i \leq 10^6
      - There is an i such that B_i \geq 1.
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      2
      800 300
      100 100
      200 10

      Sample Output 1

      5

      This refrigerator has 800 grams of ingredient 1 and 300 grams of ingredient 2.
      You can make one serving of dish A with 100 grams of ingredient 1 and 100 grams of ingredient 2, and one serving of dish B with 200 grams of ingredient 1 and 10 grams of ingredient 2.
      To make two servings of dish A and three servings of dish B, you need 100 \times 2 + 200 \times 3 = 800 grams of ingredient 1, and 100 \times 2 + 10 \times 3 = 230 grams of ingredient 2, neither of which exceeds the amount available in the refrigerator. In this way, you can make a total of five servings of dishes, but there is no way to make six, so the answer is 5.

      Sample Input 2

      2
      800 300
      100 0
      0 10

      Sample Output 2

      38

      You can make 8 servings of dish A with 800 grams of ingredient 1, and 30 servings of dish B with 300 grams of ingredient 2, for a total of 38 servings.

      Sample Input 3

      2
      800 300
      801 300
      800 301

      Sample Output 3

      0

      You cannot make any dishes.

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py to read from stdin and write the correct answer to stdout so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

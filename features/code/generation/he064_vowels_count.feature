Feature: HumanEval/64 — implement vowels_count
  Complexity: T2
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === solution.py ===

      FIX = '''
      Add more test cases.
      '''

      def vowels_count(s):
          '''Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing
          a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
          Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
          vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

          Example:
          >>> vowels_count("abcde")
          2
          >>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
          3

      def test_humaneval():

          # Check some simple cases
          assert vowels_count("abcde") == 2, "Test 1"
          assert vowels_count("Alone") == 3, "Test 2"
          assert vowels_count("key") == 2, "Test 3"
          assert vowels_count("bye") == 1, "Test 4"
          assert vowels_count("keY") == 2, "Test 5"
          assert vowels_count("bYe") == 1, "Test 6"
          assert vowels_count("ACEDY") == 3, "Test 7"

          # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
          assert True, "This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)"

  Scenario: Agent implements vowels_count so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with implementing the vowels_count function in solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

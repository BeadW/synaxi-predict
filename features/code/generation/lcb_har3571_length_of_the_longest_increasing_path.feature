Feature: LiveCodeBench/leetcode/hard — length-of-the-longest-increasing-path
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are given a 2D array of integers coordinates of length n and an integer k, where 0 <= k < n.
      coordinates[i] = [x_i, y_i] indicates the point (x_i, y_i) in a 2D plane.
      An increasing path of length m is defined as a list of points (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), ..., (x_m, y_m) such that:

      x_i < x_i + 1 and y_i < y_i + 1 for all i where 1 <= i < m.
      (x_i, y_i) is in the given coordinates for all i where 1 <= i <= m.

      Return the maximum length of an increasing path that contains coordinates[k].
 
      Example 1:

      Input: coordinates = [[3,1],[2,2],[4,1],[0,0],[5,3]], k = 1
      Output: 3
      Explanation:
      (0, 0), (2, 2), (5, 3) is the longest increasing path that contains (2, 2).

      Example 2:

      Input: coordinates = [[2,1],[7,0],[5,6]], k = 2
      Output: 2
      Explanation:
      (2, 1), (5, 6) is the longest increasing path that contains (5, 6).

 
      Constraints:

      1 <= n == coordinates.length <= 10^5
      coordinates[i].length == 2
      0 <= coordinates[i][0], coordinates[i][1] <= 10^9
      All elements in coordinates are distinct.
      0 <= k <= n - 1

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

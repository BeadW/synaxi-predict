Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — XOR Neighbors

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are given a simple undirected graph with N vertices and M edges. The i-th edge connects vertices u_i and v_i bidirectionally.
      Determine if there exists a way to write an integer between 1 and 2^{60} - 1, inclusive, on each vertex of this graph so that the following condition is satisfied:

      - For every vertex v with a degree of at least 1, the total XOR of the numbers written on its adjacent vertices (excluding v itself) is 0.


      What is XOR?

      The XOR of two non-negative integers A and B, denoted as A \oplus B, is defined as follows:


      - In the binary representation of A \oplus B, the bit at position 2^k \, (k \geq 0) is 1 if and only if exactly one of the bits at position 2^k in the binary representations of A and B is 1. Otherwise, it is 0.


      For example, 3 \oplus 5 = 6 (in binary: 011 \oplus 101 = 110).

      In general, the bitwise XOR of k integers p_1, \dots, p_k is defined as (\cdots ((p_1 \oplus p_2) \oplus p_3) \oplus \cdots \oplus p_k).  It can be proved that this is independent of the order of p_1, \dots, p_k.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N M
      u_1 v_1
      u_2 v_2
      \vdots
      u_M v_M

      Output

      If there is no way to write integers satisfying the condition, print No.
      Otherwise, let X_v be the integer written on vertex v, and print your solution in the following format. If multiple solutions exist, any of them will be accepted.
      Yes
      X_1 X_2 \dots X_N

      Constraints


      - 1 \leq N \leq 60

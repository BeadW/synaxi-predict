Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Buildings 2
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There are N buildings, building 1, building 2, \ldots, building N, arranged in this order in a straight line from west to east. Building 1 is the westernmost, and building N is the easternmost. The height of building i\ (1\leq i\leq N) is H_i.
      For a pair of integers (i,j)\ (1\leq i\lt j\leq N), building j can be seen from building i if the following condition is satisfied.

      - There is no building taller than building j between buildings i and j. In other words, there is no integer k\ (i\lt k\lt j) such that H_k > H_j.

      You are given Q queries. In the i-th query, given a pair of integers (l_i,r_i)\ (l_i\lt r_i), find the number of buildings to the east of building r_i (that is, buildings r_i + 1, r_i + 2, \ldots, N) that can be seen from both buildings l_i and r_i.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N Q
      H_1 H_2 \ldots H_N
      l_1 r_1
      l_2 r_2
      \vdots
      l_Q r_Q

      Output

      Print Q lines. The i-th line (1 \leq i \leq Q) should contain the answer to the i-th query.

      Constraints


      - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
      - 1 \leq Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
      - 1 \leq H_i \leq N
      - H_i\neq H_j\ (i\neq j)
      - 1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      5 3
      2 1 4 3 5
      1 2
      3 5
      1 4

      Sample Output 1

      0
      1


      - For the first query, among the buildings to the east of building 2, buildings 3 and 5 can be seen from both buildings 1 and 2, so the answer is 2.
      - For the second query, there are no buildings to the east of building 5.
      - For the third query, among the buildings to the east of building 4, building 5 can be seen from both buildings 1 and 4, so the answer is 1.

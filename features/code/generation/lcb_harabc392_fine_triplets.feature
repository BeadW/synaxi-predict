Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Fine Triplets
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      For integers A, B, C ( A < B < C ), if they satisfy B-A = C-B, then (A, B, C) is called a fine triplet.
      You are given a set of N distinct positive integers S = \{ S_1, S_2, \dots, S_N \}. Find the number of fine triplets (A, B, C) with A, B, C \in S.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      S_1 S_2 \dots S_N

      Output

      Print the number of fine triplets as an integer.

      Constraints


      - All input values are integers.
      - 1 \le N \le 10^6
      - 1 \le S_i \le 10^6
      - The elements of S are distinct.

      Sample Input 1

      5
      8 3 1 5 2

      Sample Output 1

      3

      Here, S = \{8,3,1,5,2\}.
      The fine triplets to be counted are the following three:

      - (1,2,3)
      - (1,3,5)
      - (2,5,8)

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

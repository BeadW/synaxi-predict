Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Teleporting Takahashi 2
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There is a simple directed graph G with N vertices and N+M edges. The vertices are numbered 1 to N, and the edges are numbered 1 to N+M.
      Edge i (1 \leq i \leq N) goes from vertex i to vertex i+1. (Here, vertex N+1 is considered as vertex 1.)
      Edge N+i (1 \leq i \leq M) goes from vertex X_i to vertex Y_i.
      Takahashi is at vertex 1. At each vertex, he can move to any vertex to which there is an outgoing edge from the current vertex.
      Compute the number of ways he can move exactly K times.
      That is, find the number of integer sequences (v_0, v_1, \dots, v_K) of length K+1 satisfying all of the following three conditions:

      - 1 \leq v_i \leq N for i = 0, 1, \dots, K.
      - v_0 = 1.
      - There is a directed edge from vertex v_{i-1} to vertex v_i for i = 1, 2, \ldots, K.

      Since this number can be very large, print it modulo 998244353.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N M K
      X_1 Y_1
      X_2 Y_2
      \vdots
      X_M Y_M

      Output

      Print the count modulo 998244353.

      Constraints


      - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
      - 0 \leq M \leq 50
      - 1 \leq K \leq 2 \times 10^5
      - 1 \leq X_i, Y_i \leq N, X_i \neq Y_i
      - All of the N+M directed edges are distinct.
      - All input values are integers.

      The above figure represents the graph G. There are five ways for Takahashi to move:

      - Vertex 1 \to Vertex 2 \to Vertex 3 \to Vertex 4 \to Vertex 5 \to Vertex 6
      - Vertex 1 \to Vertex 2 \to Vertex 5 \to Vertex 6 \to Vertex 1 \to Vertex 2
      - Vertex 1 \to Vertex 2 \to Vertex 5 \to Vertex 6 \to Vertex 1 \to Vertex 4
      - Vertex 1 \to Vertex 4 \to Vertex 5 \to Vertex 6 \to Vertex 1 \to Vertex 2
      - Vertex 1 \to Vertex 4 \to Vertex 5 \to Vertex 6 \to Vertex 1 \to Vertex 4

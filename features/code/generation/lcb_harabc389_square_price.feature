Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Square Price
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There are N types of products, each having 10^{100} units in stock.
      You can buy any non-negative number of units of each product. To buy k units of the i-th product, it costs k^2 P_i yen.
      If your total purchase cost is at most M yen, what is the maximum number of units you can buy in total?

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N M
      P_1 \ldots P_N

      Output

      Print the answer.

      Constraints


      - 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^{5}
      - 1 \leq M \leq 10^{18}
      - 1 \leq P_i \leq 2 \times 10^{9}
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      3 9
      4 1 9

      Sample Output 1

      3

      If you buy one unit of the 1st product and two units of the 2nd product, the total purchase cost is 1^2 \times 4 + 2^2 \times 1 = 8. It is impossible to buy four or more units in total with a total cost of at most 9 yen, so the answer is 3.

      Sample Input 2

      10 1000
      2 15 6 5 12 1 7 9 17 2

      Sample Output 2

      53

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

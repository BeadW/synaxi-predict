  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There are N cities in a certain country.
      You will travel from your office in city 1 to a destination in city N, via zero or more cities.
      Two types of transportation are available: company car and train. The time required to travel from city i to city j is as follows:

      - D_{i,j} \times A minutes by company car, and
      - D_{i,j} \times B + C minutes by train.

      You can switch from company car to train, but not vice versa.
      You can do so without spending time, but only in a city.
      What is the minimum time in minutes to travel from city 1 to city N?

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N A B C
      D_{1,1} D_{1,2} \ldots D_{1,N}
      D_{2,1} D_{2,2} \ldots D_{2,N}
      \vdots
      D_{N,1} D_{N,2} \ldots D_{N,N}

      Output

      Print the answer as an integer.

      Constraints


      - 2 \leq N \leq 1000
      - 1 \leq A, B, C \leq 10^6 
      - D_{i,j} \leq 10^6
      - D_{i,i} = 0
      - D_{i,j} = D_{j,i} > 0 (i \neq j)
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      4 8 5 13
      0 6 2 15
      6 0 3 5
      2 3 0 13
      15 5 13 0

      Sample Output 1

      78

      You can travel from city 1 to city 4 in a total of 78 minutes by moving as follows.

      - Travel by company car from city 1 to city 3. This takes 2 \times 8 = 16 minutes.
      - Travel by company car from city 3 to city 2. This takes 3 \times 8 = 24 minutes.
      - Travel by train from city 2 to city 4. This takes 5 \times 5 + 13 = 38 minutes.

      It is impossible to travel from city 1 to city 4 in less than 78 minutes.

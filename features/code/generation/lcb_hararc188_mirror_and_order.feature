  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are going to create N sequences of length 3, satisfying the following conditions.

      - For each of k = 1,2,3, the following holds:
      - Among the k-th elements of the sequences, each integer from 1 through N appears exactly once.



      For this sequence of sequences, define sequences a=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_N) and b=(b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_N) as follows.

      - Let s_i be the i-th sequence, and let t_i be the reverse of the i-th sequence. When all of these are sorted in lexicographical order, s_i comes a_i-th, and t_i comes b_i-th.
      - Here, if there are identical sequences among the 2N sequences, a and b are not defined.

      Therefore, if a and b are defined, each integer from 1 through 2N appears exactly once in the concatenation of a and b.
      You are given sequences A and B of length N, where each element of A is an integer between 1 and 2N, and each element of B is either an integer between 1 and 2N or -1.
      Also, in the concatenation of A and B, each integer other than -1 appears at most once.
      How many pairs of sequences a,b are there such that a and b are defined and the following holds for each integer i from 1 through N?

      - a_i = A_i.
      - b_i = B_i if B_i \neq -1.

      Find the count modulo 998244353.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
      B_1 B_2 \ldots B_N

      Output

      Print the count modulo 998244353.

      Constraints


      - 2 \leq N \leq 3000
      - 1 \leq A_i \leq 2N
      - 1 \leq B_i \leq 2N or B_i = -1.
      - In the concatenation of A and B, each integer other than -1 appears at most once. That is,
      - A_i \neq A_j if i \neq j.
      - B_i \neq B_j if i \neq j and B_i,B_j \neq -1.
      - A_i \neq B_j.


      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      3
      2 3 6
      -1 1 -1

      Sample Output 1

      1

      For example, consider creating the following three sequences:

      - (1,2,3)
      - (2,1,1)
      - (3,3,2)

      In this case, when sorting s_i and t_i lexicographically, we have:

      t_2 = (1,1,2) < s_1 = (1,2,3) < s_2 = (2,1,1) < t_3 = (2,3,3) < t_1 = (3,2,1) < s_3 = (3,3,2)

      Thus, (a_1,a_2,a_3,b_1,b_2,

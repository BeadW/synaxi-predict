Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Santa Claus 2
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There are N houses at points (X_1,Y_1),\ldots,(X_N,Y_N) on a two-dimensional plane.
      Initially, Santa Claus is at point (S_x,S_y). He will act according to the sequence (D_1,C_1),\ldots,(D_M,C_M) as follows:

      - For i=1,2,\ldots,M in order, he moves as follows:
      - Let (x,y) be the point where he currently is.
      - If D_i is U, move in a straight line from (x,y) to (x,y+C_i).
      - If D_i is D, move in a straight line from (x,y) to (x,y-C_i).
      - If D_i is L, move in a straight line from (x,y) to (x-C_i,y).
      - If D_i is R, move in a straight line from (x,y) to (x+C_i,y).





      Find the point where he is after completing all actions, and the number of distinct houses he passed through or arrived at during his actions. If the same house is passed multiple times, it is only counted once.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N M S_x S_y
      X_1 Y_1
      \vdots
      X_N Y_N
      D_1 C_1
      \vdots
      D_M C_M

      Output

      Let (X,Y) be the point where he is after completing all actions, and C be the number of distinct houses passed through or arrived at. Print X,Y,C in this order separated by spaces.

      Constraints


      - 1 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
      - 1 \leq M \leq 2\times 10^5
      - -10^9 \leq X_i,Y_i \leq 10^9
      - The pairs (X_i,Y_i) are distinct.
      - -10^9 \leq S_x,S_y \leq 10^9
      - There is no house at (S_x,S_y).
      - Each D_i is one of U, D, L, R.
      - 1 \leq C_i \leq 10^9
      - All input numbers are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      3 4 3 2
      2 2
      3 3
      2 1
      L 2
      D 1
      R 1
      U 2

      Sample Output 1

      2 3 2

      Santa Claus behaves as follows:


      - D_1= L, so he moves from (3,2) to (3-2,2) in a straight line. During this, he passes through the house at (2,2).
      - D_2= D, so he moves from (1,2) to (1,2-1) in a straight line.
      - D_3= R, so he moves from (1,1) to (1+1,1) in a straight line. During this, he passes through the house at (2,1).
      - D_4= U, so he moves from (2,1) to (2,1+2) in a straight line. During this, he passes through the house at (2,2), but it has already been passed.

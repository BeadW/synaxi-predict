  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      Takahashi has 2N teeth: N upper teeth and N lower teeth.
      The length of the i-th upper tooth from the left (1 \leq i \leq N) is U _ i, and the length of the i-th lower tooth from the left (1 \leq i \leq N) is D _ i.
      His teeth are said to “fit together well” if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

      - There exists an integer H such that U _ i + D _ i = H for every integer i with 1 \leq i \leq N.
      - \lvert U _ i - U _ {i+1} \rvert \leq X for every integer i with 1 \leq i < N.

      He can perform the following operation any number of times:

      - Pay 1 yen to use a tooth-grinding machine, choose exactly one tooth whose length is positive, and reduce its length by 1.

      No other method may be used to change the lengths of the teeth.
      Find the minimum total amount of money he needs to pay to make his teeth fit together well.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N X
      U _ 1 D _ 1
      U _ 2 D _ 2
      \vdots
      U _ N D _ N

      Output

      Print the answer.

      Constraints


      - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
      - 1 \leq U _ i \leq 10^9 \ (1 \leq i \leq N)
      - 1 \leq D _ i \leq 10^9 \ (1 \leq i \leq N)
      - 1 \leq X \leq 10^9
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      4 3
      3 1
      4 1
      5 9
      2 6

      Sample Output 1

      15

      Initially, Takahashi’s teeth have the following lengths:

      For example, you can make them fit together well in the following way:

      It costs 15 yen to achieve these lengths.
      It is impossible to make them fit together well with 14 yen or less, so print 15.

      Sample Input 2

      4 1000000000
      3 3
      3 3
      3 3
      3 3

      Sample Output 2

      0

      It is possible that the teeth already fit together well without any changes.

      Sample Input 3

      4 1
      1000000000 1000000000
      1000000000 1000000000
      1000000000 1000000000
      1 1

      Sample Output 3

      5999999994

      Note that the answer may exceed the 32-bit integer range.

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There is a grid of N^2 squares with N rows and N columns.
      Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top (1\leq i\leq N) and j-th column from the left (1\leq j\leq N).
      Each square is either empty or has a piece placed on it.
      There are M pieces placed on the grid, and the k-th (1\leq k\leq M) piece is placed on square (a_k,b_k).
      You want to place your piece on an empty square in such a way that it cannot be captured by any of the existing pieces.
      A piece placed on square (i,j) can capture pieces that satisfy any of the following conditions:

      - Placed in row i
      - Placed in column j
      - Placed on any square (a,b)\ (1\leq a\leq N,1\leq b\leq N) where i+j=a+b
      - Placed on any square (a,b)\ (1\leq a\leq N,1\leq b\leq N) where i-j=a-b

      For example, a piece placed on square (4,4) can capture pieces placed on the squares shown in blue in the following figure:

      How many squares can you place your piece on?

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N M
      a_1 b_1
      a_2 b_2
      \vdots
      a_M b_M

      Output

      Print the number of empty squares where you can place your piece without it being captured by any existing pieces.

      Constraints


      - 1\leq N\leq10^9
      - 1\leq M\leq10^3
      - 1\leq a_k\leq N,1\leq b_k\leq N\ (1\leq k\leq M)
      - (a_k,b_k)\neq(a_l,b_l)\ (1\leq k\lt l\leq M)
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      8 6
      1 4
      2 1
      3 8
      4 5
      5 2
      8 3

      Sample Output 1

      2

      The existing pieces can capture pieces placed on the squares shown in blue in the following figure:

      Therefore, you can place your piece on only two squares: squares (6,6) and (7,7).

      Sample Input 2

      1000000000 1
      1 1

      Sample Output 2

      999999997000000002

      Out of 10^{18} squares, the squares that cannot be used are: squares in row 1, squares in column 1, and squares (1,1), (2,2), \ldots, (10^9,10^9), totaling 3\times10^9-2 squares.
      Note that the answer may be 2^{32} or greater.

      Sample Input 3

      20 10
      1 4
      7 11
      7 15

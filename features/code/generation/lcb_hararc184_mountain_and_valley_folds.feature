Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Mountain and Valley Folds
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      We have a long, thin piece of paper whose thickness can be ignored. We perform the following operation 100 times: lift the right end, fold it so that it aligns with the left end using the center as a crease. After completing the 100 folds, we unfold the paper back to its original state. At this point, there are 2^{100} - 1 creases on the paper, and these creases can be classified into two types: mountain folds and valley folds. The figure below represents the state after performing the operation twice, where red solid lines represent mountain folds and red dashed lines represent valley folds.

      About mountain and valley folds

      - A crease is a mountain fold if it is folded so that the back sides of the paper come together at the crease.
      - A crease is a valley fold if it is folded so that the front sides of the paper come together at the crease.



      You are given a sequence A = (A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N) of N non-negative integers. Here, 0 = A_1 < A_2 < \dots < A_N \leq 10^{18}.
      For each integer i from 1 through 2^{100} - A_N - 1, define f(i) as follows:

      - The number of k = 1, 2, \dots, N such that the (i + A_k)-th crease from the left is a mountain fold.

      Find the maximum value among f(1), f(2), \dots, f(2^{100} - A_N - 1).

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      A_1 A_2 \cdots A_N

      Output

      Print the answer in one line.

      Constraints


      - 1 \leq N \leq 10^3
      - 0 = A_1 < A_2 < \dots < A_N \leq 10^{18}

      Sample Input 1

      4
      0 1 2 3

      Sample Output 1

      3

      If mountain and valley folds are represented by M and V, respectively, there is a contiguous subsequence of creases like MMVM. There is no contiguous subsequence like MMMM, so the answer is 3.

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

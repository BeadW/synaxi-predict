      Snuke the doctor prescribed N kinds of medicine for Takahashi.  For the next a_i days (including the day of the prescription), he has to take b_i pills of the i-th medicine.  He does not have to take any other medicine.
      Let the day of the prescription be day 1.  On or after day 1, when is the first day on which he has to take K pills or less?

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N K
      a_1 b_1
      \vdots
      a_N b_N

      Output

      If Takahashi has to take K pills or less on day X for the first time on or after day 1, print X.

      Constraints


      - 1 \leq N \leq 3 \times 10^5
      - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
      - 1 \leq a_i,b_i \leq 10^9
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      4 8
      6 3
      2 5
      1 9
      4 2

      Sample Output 1

      On day 1, he has to take 3,5,9, and 2 pills of the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, and 4-th medicine, respectively.  In total, he has to take 19 pills on this day, which is not K(=8) pills or less.
      On day 2, he has to take 3,5, and 2 pills of the 1-st, 2-nd, and 4-th medicine, respectively.  In total, he has to take 10 pills on this day, which is not K(=8) pills or less.
      On day 3, he has to take 3 and 2 pills of the 1-st and 4-th medicine, respectively.  In total, he has to take 5 pills on this day, which is K(=8) pills or less for the first time.  
      Thus, the answer is 3.

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py to read from stdin and write the correct answer to stdout so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

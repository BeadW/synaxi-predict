Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — 3 Team Division
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There are N people divided into three teams.
      The people are numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N, and the teams are numbered 1, 2, 3. Currently, person i belongs to team A_i.
      Each person has a value called strength; person i has a strength of B_i. The strength of a team is defined as the sum of the strengths of its members.
      Determine whether it is possible for zero or more people to switch teams so that all teams have equal strength. If it is possible, find the minimum number of people who need to switch teams to achieve this.
      You cannot create new teams other than teams 1, 2, 3.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      A_1 B_1
      A_2 B_2
      \vdots
      A_N B_N

      Output

      If it is possible to make all teams have equal strength, print the minimum number of people who need to switch teams. Otherwise, print -1.

      Constraints


      - 3 \leq N \leq 100
      - A_i \in \lbrace 1, 2, 3 \rbrace
      - For each x \in \lbrace 1, 2, 3 \rbrace, there exists some i with A_i = x.
      - 1 \leq B_i
      - \displaystyle\sum_{i = 1}^{N} B_i \leq 1500 
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      6
      1 2
      2 5

      3 3
      1 3
      3 6

      Sample Output 1

      2

      If person 1 switches to team 3 and person 4 switches to team 2, all teams will have a strength of 8.

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

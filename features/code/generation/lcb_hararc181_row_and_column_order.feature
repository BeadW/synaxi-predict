Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Row and Column Order
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are given two permutations P=(P_1,P_2,\dots,P_N) and Q=(Q_1,Q_2,\dots,Q_N) of (1,2,\dots,N).
      Write one of the characters 0 and 1 in each cell of an N-by-N grid so that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

      - Let S_i be the string obtained by concatenating the characters in the i-th row from the 1-st to the N-th column. Then, S_{P_1} < S_{P_2} < \dots < S_{P_N} in lexicographical order.
      - Let T_i be the string obtained by concatenating the characters in the i-th column from the 1-st to the N-th row. Then, T_{Q_1} < T_{Q_2} < \dots < T_{Q_N} in lexicographical order.

      It can be proved that for any P and Q, there is at least one way to write the characters that satisfies all the conditions.
       What does "X < Y in lexicographical order" mean?
      For strings X=X_1X_2\dots X_{|X|} and Y = Y_1Y_2\dots Y_{|Y|}, "X < Y in lexicographical order" means that 1. or 2. below holds.
      Here, |X| and |Y| denote the lengths of X and Y, respectively.

      -  |X| \lt |Y| and X_1X_2\ldots X_{|X|} = Y_1Y_2\ldots Y_{|X|}. 
      -  There exists an integer 1 \leq i \leq \min\lbrace |X|, |Y| \rbrace such that both of the following are true:

      -  X_1X_2\ldots X_{i-1} = Y_1Y_2\ldots Y_{i-1}
      -  X_i is less than Y_i.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      P_1 P_2 \dots P_N
      Q_1 Q_2 \dots Q_N

      Output

      Print a way to fill the grid that satisfies the conditions in the following format, where A_{ij} is the character written at the i-th row and j-th column:
      A_{11}A_{12}\dots A_{1N}
      \vdots
      A_{N1}A_{N2}\dots A_{NN}

      If there are multiple ways to satisfy the conditions, any of them will be accepted.

      Constraints


      - 2 \leq N \leq 500
      - P and Q are permutations of (1,2,\dots,N).
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      3
      1 2 3
      2 1 3

      Sample Output 1

      001
      101
      110

      In this sample, S_1=001, S_2=101, S_3=110, and T_1=011, T_2=001, T_3=110. Therefore, S_1 < S_2 < S_3 and T_2 < T_1 < T_3 hold, satisfying the conditions.

      Sample Input 2

Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Reachability in Functional Graph
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There is a directed graph with N vertices numbered 1 to N and N edges.
      The out-degree of every vertex is 1, and the edge from vertex i points to vertex a_i.
      Count the number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that vertex v is reachable from vertex u.
      Here, vertex v is reachable from vertex u if there exists a sequence of vertices w_0, w_1, \dots, w_K of length K+1 that satisfies the following conditions. In particular, if u = v, it is always reachable.

      - w_0 = u.
      - w_K = v.
      - For every 0 \leq i \lt K, there is an edge from vertex w_i to vertex w_{i+1}.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      a_1 a_2 \dots a_N

      Output

      Print the number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that vertex v is reachable from vertex u.

      Constraints


      - 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
      - 1 \leq a_i \leq N
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      4
      2 1 1 4

      Sample Output 1

      8

      The vertices reachable from vertex 1 are vertices 1, 2.
      The vertices reachable from vertex 2 are vertices 1, 2.
      The vertices reachable from vertex 3 are vertices 1, 2, 3.
      The vertex reachable from vertex 4 is vertex 4.
      Therefore, the number of pairs of vertices (u, v) such that vertex v is reachable from vertex u is 8.
      Note that the edge from vertex 4 is a self-loop, that is, it points to vertex 4 itself.

      Sample Input 2

      5
      2 4 3 1 2

      Sample Output 2

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

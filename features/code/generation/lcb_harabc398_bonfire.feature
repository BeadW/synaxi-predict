Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Bonfire
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      There is an infinitely large two-dimensional grid, with a campfire at coordinate (0,0).
      At time t=0, smoke exists only at cell (0,0).
      You are given a length-N string S consisting of N, W, S, E. At times t=1,2,\dots,N, the following happen in order:

      - Wind blows, and all the smoke present at that time moves as follows:
      - If the t-th character of S is N, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r-1,c).
      - If it is W, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r,c-1).
      - If it is S, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r+1,c).
      - If it is E, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r,c+1).


      - If there is no smoke in cell (0,0), new smoke is generated at cell (0,0).

      Takahashi is standing at cell (R,C).
      For each integer 1 \le t \le N, determine if smoke exists at cell (R,C) at time t+0.5, and print the response according to the required format.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N R C
      S

      Output

      Print an N-character string consisting of 0 and 1.
      The t-th character (1 \le t \le N) should be:

      - 1 if smoke exists at cell (R,C) at time t+0.5, and
      - 0 otherwise.

      Constraints


      - N is an integer between 1 and 200000, inclusive.
      - S is a length N string consisting of N, W, S, E.
      - R and C are integers between -N and N, inclusive.
      - (R,C) \neq (0,0)

      Sample Input 1

      6 -2 1
      NNEEWS

      Sample Output 1

      001010

      At times 1.5,2.5,4.5,6.5, there is no smoke at cell (-2,1). At times 3.5,5.5, there is smoke at cell (-2,1).
      Hence, output 001010.
      In the figures below, taking cell (0,0) with the campfire as a reference, cell (r,c) is drawn:

      - -r cells up if r < 0,
      - r cells down if r \ge 0,
      - -c cells left if c < 0,
      - c cells right if c \ge 0.

      The grid at time 0.5 looks like:

      The grid at time 1.5 looks like:

      The grid at time 2.5 looks like:

      The grid at time 3.5 looks like:

      The grid at time 4.5 looks like:

      The grid at time 5.5 looks like:

      The grid at time 6.5 looks like:

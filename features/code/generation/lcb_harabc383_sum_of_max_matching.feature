Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Sum of Max Matching
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are given a simple connected undirected graph with N vertices and M edges, where vertices are numbered 1 to N and edges are numbered 1 to M. Edge i (1 \leq i \leq M) connects vertices u_i and v_i bidirectionally and has weight w_i.
      For a path, define its weight as the maximum weight of an edge in the path.
      Define f(x, y) as the minimum possible path weight of a path from vertex x to vertex y.
      You are given two sequences of length K: (A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_K) and (B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_K). It is guaranteed that A_i \neq B_j (1 \leq i,j \leq K).
      Permute the sequence B freely so that \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{K} f(A_i, B_i) is minimized.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N M K
      u_1 v_1 w_1
      u_2 v_2 w_2
      \vdots
      u_M v_M w_M
      A_1 A_2 \ldots A_K
      B_1 B_2 \ldots B_K

      Output

      Print the minimum value of \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{K} f(A_i, B_i).

      Constraints


      - 2 \leq N  \leq 2 \times 10^5
      - N-1 \leq M  \leq \min(\frac{N \times (N-1)}{2},2 \times 10^5)
      - 1 \leq K \leq N
      - 1 \leq u_i<v_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq M) 
      - 1 \leq w_i \leq 10^9
      - 1 \leq A_i,B_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq K)
      - The given graph is simple and connected.
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      4 4 3
      1 3 2
      3 4 1
      2 4 5
      1 4 4
      1 1 3
      4 4 2

      Sample Output 1

      8

      If we rearrange B as (2,4,4):

      - f(1,2) = 5: The path from vertex 1 to vertex 2 passing through vertex 4 contains edge 3 with a maximum edge weight of 5. There is no path with a maximum edge weight less than or equal to 4, so 5 is the minimum possible.
      - f(1,4) = 2: The path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 passing through vertex 3 contains edge 1 with a maximum edge weight of 2. There is no path with a maximum edge weight less than or equal to 1, so 2 is the minimum possible.
      - f(3,4) = 1: The path from vertex 3 to vertex 4 passing through the direct edge contains an edge with a maximum edge weight of 1. No path can have a maximum weight 0 or less, so 1 is the minimum possible.

      Thus, \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{3} f(A_i, B_i)

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox

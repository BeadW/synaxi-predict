  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are given a weighted undirected graph G with N vertices, numbered 1 to N. Initially, G has no edges.
      You will perform M operations to add edges to G. The i-th operation (1 \leq i \leq M) is as follows:

      - You are given a subset of vertices S_i=\lbrace A_{i,1},A_{i,2},\dots,A_{i,K_i}\rbrace consisting of K_i vertices.
      For every pair u, v such that u, v \in S_i and u < v, add an edge between vertices u and v with weight C_i.

      After performing all M operations, determine whether G is connected. If it is, find the total weight of the edges in a minimum spanning tree of G.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N M
      K_1 C_1
      A_{1,1} A_{1,2} \dots A_{1,K_1}
      K_2 C_2
      A_{2,1} A_{2,2} \dots A_{2,K_2}
      \vdots
      K_M C_M
      A_{M,1} A_{M,2} \dots A_{M,K_M}

      Output

      If G is not connected after all M operations, print -1. If G is connected, print the total weight of the edges in a minimum spanning tree of G.

      Constraints


      - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
      - 1 \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^5
      - 2 \leq K_i \leq N
      - \sum_{i=1}^{M} K_i \leq 4 \times 10^5
      - 1 \leq A_{i,1} < A_{i,2} < \dots < A_{i,K_i} \leq N
      - 1 \leq C_i \leq 10^9
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      4 3
      3 3
      1 2 3
      2 2
      1 2
      3 4
      1 3 4

      Sample Output 1

      9


      The left diagram shows G after all M operations, and the right diagram shows a minimum spanning tree of G (the numbers next to the edges indicate their weights).
      The total weight of the edges in the minimum spanning tree is 3 + 2 + 4 = 9.

      Sample Input 2

      3 2
      2 1
      1 2
      2 1
      1 2

      Sample Output 2

      -1

      G is not connected even after all M operations.

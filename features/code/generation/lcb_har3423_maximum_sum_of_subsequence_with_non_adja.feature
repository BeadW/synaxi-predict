Feature: LiveCodeBench/leetcode/hard — maximum-sum-of-subsequence-with-non-adjacent-elements
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are given an array nums consisting of integers. You are also given a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [pos_i, x_i].
      For query i, we first set nums[pos_i] equal to x_i, then we calculate the answer to query i which is the maximum sum of a subsequence of nums where no two adjacent elements are selected.
      Return the sum of the answers to all queries.
      Since the final answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
      A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 
      Example 1:

      Input: nums = [3,5,9], queries = [[1,-2],[0,-3]]
      Output: 21
      Explanation:
      After the 1^st query, nums = [3,-2,9] and the maximum sum of a subsequence with non-adjacent elements is 3 + 9 = 12.
      After the 2^nd query, nums = [-3,-2,9] and the maximum sum of a subsequence with non-adjacent elements is 9.

      Example 2:

      Input: nums = [0,-1], queries = [[0,-5]]
      Output: 0
      Explanation:
      After the 1^st query, nums = [-5,-1] and the maximum sum of a subsequence with non-adjacent elements is 0 (choosing an empty subsequence).

 
      Constraints:

      1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
      -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
      1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4
      queries[i] == [pos_i, x_i]
      0 <= pos_i <= nums.length - 1
      -10^5 <= x_i <= 10^5

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Sensor Optimization Dilemma 2
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      The manufacturing of a certain product requires N processes numbered 1,2,\dots,N.
      For each process i, there are two types of machines S_i and T_i available for purchase to handle it.

      - Machine S_i: Can process A_i products per day per unit, and costs P_i yen per unit.
      - Machine T_i: Can process B_i products per day per unit, and costs Q_i yen per unit.

      You can purchase any number of each machine, possibly zero.
      Suppose that process i can handle W_i products per day as a result of introducing machines.
      Here, we define the production capacity as the minimum of W, that is, \displaystyle \min^{N}_{i=1} W_i.
      Given a total budget of X yen, find the maximum achievable production capacity.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N X
      A_1 P_1 B_1 Q_1
      A_2 P_2 B_2 Q_2
      \vdots
      A_N P_N B_N Q_N

      Output

      Print the answer as an integer.

      Constraints


      - All input values are integers.
      - 1 \le N \le 100
      - 1 \le A_i,B_i \le 100
      - 1 \le P_i,Q_i,X \le 10^7

      Sample Input 1

      3 22
      2 5 3 6
      1 1 3 3
      1 3 2 4

      Sample Output 1

      4

      For example, by introducing machines as follows, we can achieve a production capacity of 4, which is the maximum possible.

      - For process 1, introduce 2 units of machine S_1.
      - This allows processing 4 products per day and costs a total of 10 yen.


      - For process 2, introduce 1 unit of machine S_2.
      - This allows processing 1 product per day and costs a total of 1 yen.


      - For process 2, introduce 1 unit of machine T_2.
      - This allows processing 3 products per day and costs a total of 3 yen.


      - For process 3, introduce 2 units of machine T_3.
      - This allows processing 4 products per day and costs a total of 8 yen.

      Sample Input 2

      1 10000000
      100 1 100 1

      Sample Output 2

      1000000000

      Sample Input 3

      1 1
      1 10000000 1 10000000

      Sample Output 3

      0

      There may be cases where a positive production capacity cannot be achieved.

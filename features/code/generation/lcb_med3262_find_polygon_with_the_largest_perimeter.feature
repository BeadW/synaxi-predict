Feature: LiveCodeBench/leetcode/medium — find-polygon-with-the-largest-perimeter
  Complexity: T2
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are given an array of positive integers nums of length n.
      A polygon is a closed plane figure that has at least 3 sides. The longest side of a polygon is smaller than the sum of its other sides.
      Conversely, if you have k (k >= 3) positive real numbers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_k where a_1 <= a_2 <= a_3 <= ... <= a_k and a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_k-1 > a_k, then there always exists a polygon with k sides whose lengths are a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_k.
      The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of lengths of its sides.
      Return the largest possible perimeter of a polygon whose sides can be formed from nums, or -1 if it is not possible to create a polygon.
 
      Example 1:

      Input: nums = [5,5,5]
      Output: 15
      Explanation: The only possible polygon that can be made from nums has 3 sides: 5, 5, and 5. The perimeter is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.

      Example 2:

      Input: nums = [1,12,1,2,5,50,3]
      Output: 12
      Explanation: The polygon with the largest perimeter which can be made from nums has 5 sides: 1, 1, 2, 3, and 5. The perimeter is 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12.
      We cannot have a polygon with either 12 or 50 as the longest side because it is not possible to include 2 or more smaller sides that have a greater sum than either of them.
      It can be shown that the largest possible perimeter is 12.

      Example 3:

      Input: nums = [5,5,50]
      Output: -1
      Explanation: There is no possible way to form a polygon from nums, as a polygon has at least 3 sides and 50 > 5 + 5.

 
      Constraints:

      3 <= n <= 10^5

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

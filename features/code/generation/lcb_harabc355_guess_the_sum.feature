Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Guess the Sum
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      This is an interactive problem (where your program interacts with the judge via input and output).
      You are given a positive integer N and integers L and R such that 0 \leq L \leq R < 2^N. The judge has a hidden sequence A = (A_0, A_1, \dots, A_{2^N-1}) consisting of integers between 0 and 99, inclusive.
      Your goal is to find the remainder when A_L + A_{L+1} + \dots + A_R is divided by 100. However, you cannot directly know the values of the elements in the sequence A. Instead, you can ask the judge the following question:

      - Choose non-negative integers i and j such that 2^i(j+1) \leq 2^N. Let l = 2^i j and r = 2^i (j+1) - 1. Ask for the remainder when A_l + A_{l+1} + \dots + A_r is divided by 100.

      Let m be the minimum number of questions required to determine the remainder when A_L + A_{L+1} + \dots + A_R is divided by 100 for any sequence A. You need to find this remainder within m questions.

      Input and Output

      This is an interactive problem (where your program interacts with the judge via input and output).
      First, read the integers N, L, and R from Standard Input:
      N L R

      Then, repeat asking questions until you can determine the remainder when A_L + A_{L+1} + \dots + A_R is divided by 100. Each question should be printed in the following format:
      ? i j

      Here, i and j must satisfy the following constraints:

      - i and j are non-negative integers.
      - 2^i(j+1) \leq 2^N

      The response to the question will be given in the following format from Standard Input:
      T

      Here, T is the answer to the question, which is the remainder when A_l + A_{l+1} + \dots + A_r is divided by 100, where l = 2^i j and r = 2^i (j+1) - 1.
      If i and j do not satisfy the constraints, or if the number of questions exceeds m, then T will be -1.
      If the judge returns -1, your program is already considered incorrect. In this case, terminate the program immediately.
      Once you have determined the remainder when A_L + A_{L+1} + \dots + A_R is divided by 100, print the remainder S in the following format and t

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

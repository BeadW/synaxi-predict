Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Replace
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are given a positive integer N and two strings S and T, each of length N and consisting of lowercase English letters.
      Determine whether it is possible to make S identical to T by repeating the operation below any number of times (possibly zero). If it is possible, also find the minimum number of operations required.

      - Choose two lowercase English letters x, y and replace every occurrence of x in S with y.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      S
      T

      Output

      If it is possible to make S identical to T, print the minimum number of operations required. Otherwise, print -1.

      Constraints


      - 1\leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
      - N is an integer.
      - Each of S and T is a string of length N, consisting of lowercase English letters.

      Sample Input 1

      6
      afbfda
      bkckbb

      Sample Output 1

      4

      By performing the operation four times in the following way, you can make S identical to T:

      - Choose x= b and y= c. S becomes afcfda.
      - Choose x= a and y= b. S becomes bfcfdb.
      - Choose x= f and y= k. S becomes bkckdb.
      - Choose x= d and y= b. S becomes bkckbb, which is identical to T.

      It cannot be done with fewer than four operations, so the minimum number of operations required is 4.

      Sample Input 2

      4
      abac
      abac

      Sample Output 2

      0

      S and T are already identical, so no operations are required.

      Sample Input 3

      4
      abac
      abrc

      Sample Output 3

      -1

      No matter how you repeat the operation, it is impossible to make S identical to T.

      Sample Input 4

      4
      abac
      bcba

      Sample Output 4

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox

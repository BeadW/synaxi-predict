Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — A Gift From the Stars
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      A graph with (k+1) vertices and k edges is called a level-k\ (k\geq 2) star if and only if:

      - it has a vertex that is connected to each of the other k vertices with an edge, and there are no other edges.

      At first, Takahashi had a graph consisting of stars.  He repeated the following operation until every pair of vertices in the graph was connected:

      - choose two vertices in the graph.  Here, the vertices must be disconnected, and their degrees must be both 1.  Add an edge that connects the chosen two vertices.

      He then arbitrarily assigned an integer from 1 through N to each of the vertices in the graph after the procedure.  The resulting graph is a tree; we call it T.  T has (N-1) edges, the i-th of which connects u_i and v_i.
      Takahashi has now forgotten the number and levels of the stars that he initially had.  Find them, given T.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      u_1 v_1
      \vdots
      u_{N-1} v_{N-1}

      Output

      Suppose that Takahashi initially had M stars, whose levels were L=(L_1,L_2,\ldots,L_M).
      Sort L in ascending order, and print them with spaces in between.
      We can prove that the solution is unique in this problem.

      Constraints


      - 3\leq N\leq 2\times 10^5
      - 1\leq u_i, v_i\leq N
      - The given graph is an N-vertex tree obtained by the procedure in the problem statement.
      - All values in the input are integers.

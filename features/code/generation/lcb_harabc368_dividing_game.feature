Feature: LiveCodeBench/atcoder/hard — Dividing Game
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === problem.txt ===
      You are given a sequence of N positive integers A = (A_1, A_2, \dots ,A_N), where each element is at least 2. Anna and Bruno play a game using these integers. They take turns, with Anna going first, performing the following operation.

      - Choose an integer i \ (1 \leq i \leq N) freely. Then, freely choose a positive divisor x of A_i that is not A_i itself, and replace A_i with x.

      The player who cannot perform the operation loses, and the other player wins. Determine who wins assuming both players play optimally for victory.

      Input

      The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
      N
      A_1 A_2 \cdots A_N

      Output

      Print Anna if Anna wins the game, and Bruno if Bruno wins.

      Constraints


      - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
      - 2 \leq A_i \leq 10^5
      - All input values are integers.

      Sample Input 1

      3
      2 3 4

      Sample Output 1

      Anna

      For example, the game might proceed as follows. Note that this example may not necessarily represent optimal play by both players:

      - Anna changes A_3 to 2.
      - Bruno changes A_1 to 1.
      - Anna changes A_2 to 1.
      - Bruno changes A_3 to 1.
      - Anna cannot operate on her turn, so Bruno wins.

      Actually, for this sample, Anna always wins if she plays optimally.

      Sample Input 2

      4
      2 3 4 6

      Sample Output 2

  Scenario: Agent solves the LiveCodeBench problem so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with reading problem.txt and implementing solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0

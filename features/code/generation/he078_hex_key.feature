Feature: HumanEval/78 — implement hex_key
  Complexity: T3
  Category: code/generation
  Mode: multi-turn

  Background:
    Given the following project files:
      """
      === solution.py ===

      def hex_key(num):
          '''You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
          a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
          digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
          greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
          Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
          Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
          So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
          B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
          Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
          and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
          Examples:
          For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
          For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
          For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
          For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
          For num = "2020" the output should be 2.
          '''

  Scenario: Agent implements hex_key so all tests pass
    Given an agent is tasked with implementing the hex_key function in solution.py so all pytest tests pass
    When the agent completes the task in the sandbox
    Then pytest exits with code 0
